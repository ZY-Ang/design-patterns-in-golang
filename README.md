# design-patterns-in-golang

This repo contains examples and snippets from the classical book [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), **written in go**.

The codebase is organized by use case, or more accurately, problems requiring redesign. Similar to chapter 1.6's section on designing for change:

1. Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly
2. Dependence on specific operations
3. Dependence on hardware and software platform
4. Dependence on object representations or implementations
5. Algorithmic dependencies
6. Tight coupling
7. Extending functionality by subclassing
8. Inability to alter classes conveniently
