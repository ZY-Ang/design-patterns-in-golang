# 5. Algorithmic dependencies

Algorithms are often extended, optimized, and replaced during development and reuse. Objects that depend on an algorithm will have to change when the algorithm changes. Therefore algorithms that are likely to change should be isolated.

Design patterns:
- [Builder](./builder),
- [Iterator](./iterator),
- [Strategy](./strategy),
- [Template Method](./templatemethod),
- [Visitor](./visitor)
