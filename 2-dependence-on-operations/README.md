# 2. Dependence on specific operations

When you specify a particular operation, you commit to one way of satisfying a request. By avoiding hard-coded requests, you make it easier to change the way a request gets satisfied both at compile-time and at run-time.

Design patterns:
- [Chain of Responsibility](./chainofresponsibility),
- [Command](./command)
