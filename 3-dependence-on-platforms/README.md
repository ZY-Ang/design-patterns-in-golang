# 3. Dependence on hardware and software platform

External operating system interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) are different on different hardware and software platforms. Software that depends on a particular platform will be harder to port to other platforms. It may even be difficult to keep it up to date on its native platform. Itâ€™s important therefore to design your system to limit its platform dependencies.

Design patterns:
- [Abstract Factory](./abstractfactory),
- [Bridge](./bridge)
