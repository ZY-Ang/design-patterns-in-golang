# 4. Dependence on object representations or implementations

Clients that know how an object is represented, stored, located, or implemented might need to be changed when the object changes. Hiding this information from clients keeps changes from cascading.

Design patterns:
- [Abstract Factory](./abstractfactory),
- [Bridge](./bridge),
- [Memento](./memento),
- [Proxy](./proxy)
