# 1. Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly

Specifying a class name when you create an object commits you to a particular implementation instead of a particular interface. This commitment can complicate future changes. To avoid it, create objects indirectly.

Design patterns:
- [Abstract Factory](./abstractfactory),
- [Factory Method](./factorymethod),
- [Prototype](./prototype)
