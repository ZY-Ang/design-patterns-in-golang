# 8. Inability to alter classes conveniently

Sometimes you have to modify a class that can’t be modified conveniently. Perhaps you need the source code and don’t have it (as may be the case with a commercial class library). Or maybe any change would require modifying lots of existing subclasses. Design patterns offer ways to modify classes in such circumstances.

Design patterns:
- [Adapter](./adapter),
- [Decorator](./decorator),
- [Visitor](./visitor)
